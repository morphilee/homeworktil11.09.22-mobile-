        SusieCakes' founder, Susan Sarich, grew up in Chicago, where she was
        called Susie by her two beloved grandmothers, Mildred and Madeline.<br />
        Every day Susie would come home from school to enjoy her grandmothers’
        company over a glass of milk and a fresh baked treat.<br />
        This daily baking ritual and special time together in the kitchen left a
        lasting impression.<br />
        When Susie grew up to become Susan and moved to the West Coast, she
        brought along her grandmothers’ carefully recorded recipes on
        handwritten 3×5 cards.<br />
        The pure and simple connection those recipes fostered helped Susan form
        SusieCakes bakeries to share her experience with others.<br />
        Through SusieCakes, Susan honors Mildred and Madeline: both in her
        dedication to their baking traditions, and her commitment to providing
        women with progressive careers in the food & hospitality industry.
        <br />“You most likely recall a cake as part of your life’s milestone
        celebrations. <br />Cake has the unique ability to connect us with the
        people and events of our past.<br />
        However, cake should not be reserved only for these special
        occasions.<br />
        A delicious slice of cake can immediately bring a bit of celebration to
        an ordinary day.<br /><br />
        <span>
          I hope you enjoy SusieCakes on your special occasions, as well as all
          the days in between.”</span
